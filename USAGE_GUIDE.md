# üìö Celestial Forge Usage Guide

Complete guide for using the Celestial Forge Character Sheet system in various scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Standalone Web Interface (Easiest)
```bash
# In the repository directory
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/forge-enhanced.html
```

### Option 2: SillyTavern Extension (Recommended for ST users)
```bash
# Run the installer
./install-sillytavern.sh /path/to/your/SillyTavern
# Restart SillyTavern and enable the extension
```

### Option 3: MCP Server (For AI applications)
```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install && npm start
# Configure your MCP client
```

## üéØ Core Workflow

### 1. CP (Choice Points) Management

**Automatic Tracking (Recommended)**:
- Paste AI responses containing CP mentions
- System automatically detects patterns like:
  - "You have 500 Choice Points"
  - "CP: 450"
  - "500 CP remaining"
  - "Remaining choice points: 300"

**Manual Management**:
- Use "Add CP" button for direct CP addition
- "Subtract CP" for manual deduction
- "Reset CP" to clear all CP data

### 2. Perk Selection Process

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Ensure you have CP** (current CP > 0)
2. **Choose Domain**: Select from 4 randomly generated domains
3. **Choose Perk**: Select from up to 4 affordable perks in that domain
4. **Automatic Processing**: Perk added to sheet, CP deducted
5. **Repeat**: Return to domain selection for additional perks

**Domain Categories Include**:
- Assistants (helpers, companions, AI)
- Breeding (genetics, reproduction)
- Crafting - Artisan (artistic creation)
- Databases - Magical (knowledge repositories)
- Facilities - Magical (workshops, labs)
- Knowledge - Reverse Engineering
- Quality - Resources
- Skills - Alchemy
- Supplies - Mundane
- Vehicles (transportation, mechs)
- And many more...

### 3. Sheet Management

**View Current Sheet**:
- See all selected perks with details
- Track total CP spent
- Remove individual perks (with CP refund)

**Export for AI**:
- Copy formatted output for AI responses
- Generated in the exact format requested:
```html
<div align="center"> <b>THE CELESTIAL FORGE</b> </div>
<hr>
[Perk Name] - Origin - CP Cost
[Perk Description]
<hr>
Current CP: XXX
Total Perks: X
<hr>
```

## üîß Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Solo Roleplay with AI

**Setup**: Use standalone web interface
**Workflow**:
1. Open `forge-enhanced.html`
2. Start with some CP (manually add or parse from AI)
3. Select perks based on story progression
4. Copy export and paste into AI prompts
5. AI includes perk information in responses

**Example AI Prompt**:
```
[Your roleplay context...]

Current Character Sheet:
<div align="center"> <b>THE CELESTIAL FORGE</b> </div>
<hr>
[Butler] - Big O - 100 CP
This old man offers to be your butler, capable of cooking, repairing tech, and helping with daily life. Comes with a motorcycle with rocket launcher.
<hr>
Current CP: 400
Total Perks: 1
<hr>

Continue the story, and if I gain more CP, include it in your response.
```

### Scenario 2: SillyTavern Integration

**Setup**: Install SillyTavern extension
**Workflow**:
1. Extension automatically tracks CP from AI responses
2. Use extension panel to select perks
3. Export functionality copies to clipboard
4. Paste into SillyTavern messages or persona description

**Benefits**:
- Automatic CP detection from all messages
- Integrated UI within SillyTavern
- Persistent storage between sessions
- One-click perk selection and export

### Scenario 3: Group Roleplay

**Setup**: Share the standalone interface URL
**Workflow**:
1. Host runs local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Share `http://your-ip:8000/forge-enhanced.html` with group
3. Each player manages their own sheet
4. GM tracks CP awards and player progress
5. Players export sheets for character updates

### Scenario 4: MCP with Claude/AI

**Setup**: Configure MCP server
**Workflow**:
```
User: "I just defeated the boss. Parse this response for CP: 'Your victory grants you 750 choice points to spend.'"

Claude: [Uses parse_cp_from_text tool]
Found CP: 750. Updated from 200 to 750. Total CP earned: 1050

User: "Show me available domains for perk selection"

Claude: [Uses get_domain_options tool]
Available domains:
- Assistants (46 total, 1 affordable)
- Crafting - Artisan (100 total, 42 affordable)
- Vehicles (57 total, 43 affordable)

User: "Get perks from Assistants domain"

Claude: [Uses get_perks_from_domain tool]
Available perks from Assistants:
**Butler** (Big O) [100 CP]
This old man offers to be your butler, capable of cooking...

User: "Select the Butler perk"

Claude: [Uses select_perk tool]
Successfully selected "Butler" for 100 CP. Remaining CP: 650

User: "Generate my current sheet"

Claude: [Uses generate_sheet_export tool]
<div align="center"> <b>THE CELESTIAL FORGE</b> </div>
<hr>
[Butler] - Big O - 100 CP
This old man offers to be your butler...
<hr>
Current CP: 650
Total Perks: 1
<hr>
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### CP Management
- **Start conservatively**: Don't spend all CP immediately
- **Track story beats**: Major victories = more CP
- **Plan ahead**: Save CP for expensive, powerful perks
- **Use auto-parsing**: Let the system track CP for you

### Perk Selection Strategy
- **Synergy focus**: Choose perks that complement each other
- **Story-driven**: Select perks that fit your character's journey
- **Domain diversity**: Explore different domains for variety
- **Cost consideration**: Balance cheap utility with expensive power

### Integration Tips
- **Regular exports**: Keep your AI/character sheet updated
- **Backup data**: Save/export your sheet regularly
- **Clear formatting**: Ensure exported text is properly formatted
- **Consistency**: Use the same format across all platforms

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### CP Not Detected
- Check the text contains clear CP values
- Try manual parsing with "Parse AI Response" button
- Use standard formats: "CP: 500" or "500 Choice Points"
- Verify auto-tracking is enabled (SillyTavern extension)

### Perks Not Loading
- Ensure `perks.json` is present and accessible
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server is running (for web interface)
- Try refreshing the page

### Export Issues
- Try manual copy from textarea if clipboard fails
- Check that perks are actually selected
- Verify the format matches expected output
- Test with different browsers if needed

### SillyTavern Extension Issues
- Verify extension is in correct directory
- Check all files are present (manifest.json, index.js, etc.)
- Restart SillyTavern completely
- Enable extension in Extensions tab
